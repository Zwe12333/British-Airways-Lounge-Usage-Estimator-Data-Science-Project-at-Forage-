# BA Lounge Eligibility Forecasting Model

This project builds a scalable, lookup-based model to estimate British Airways lounge eligibility across different tiers—Concorde Room (Tier 1), First Lounge (Tier 2), and Club Lounge (Tier 3). 

The model is designed to support long-term planning at Heathrow Terminal 3 by forecasting lounge usage without relying on specific aircraft or flight-level passenger data. Instead, it uses high-level, flexible groupings such as:

- Time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)
- Route type (Short-haul vs Long-haul)
- Destination region
- Tier-based eligibility assumptions

## What This Project Includes
- A fully interactive **Google Colab notebook**  
- A reusable **lookup table** for lounge eligibility modelling  
- Automated flight classification logic  
- Lounge demand estimation per flight  
- Exported results (CSV + Excel)  
- A polished PDF explaining the modelling approach  
- Simple visualizations for passenger distribution across tiers  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Lookup table modelling  
- Feature engineering (time-of-day, route type, haul classification)  
- Forecasting logic  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)  
- Real-world airline operations analysis  
- Clear documentation & reporting
