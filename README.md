# Lounge Eligibility Lookup — Data Science Project

Author: Hlangalezwe Zulu

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook and a PDF describing a lookup-based model to estimate British Airways lounge eligibility (Tier 1: Concorde Room, Tier 2: First, Tier 3: Club). The Colab notebook ingests a flight schedule (.xlsx), classifies flights, applies the lookup table, and exports lounge estimates.

Files:
- `Lounge_Eligibility_Project_Colab.ipynb` — runnable notebook
- `Lounge_Eligibility_Lookup_Justification.pdf` — project write-up
